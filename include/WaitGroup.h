     * @brief Exception representing multiple exceptions that occurred during the execution of tasks.
     *
     * This exception is thrown when a `WaitGroup` encounters multiple exceptions from its tasks.
     * It aggregates all the exceptions into a single container, allowing the caller to inspect
     * and handle each individual exception.
     *
     * @details
     * - The `AggregatedException` stores a vector of `std::exception_ptr` objects, each representing
     *   an exception thrown by a task.
     * - The `what()` method provides a summary message indicating the number of exceptions.
     * - The `getExceptions()` method allows access to the individual exceptions for detailed handling.
     *
     * Example usage:
     * @code
     * try {
     *     waitGroup.Wait();
     * } catch (const AggregatedException& ex) {
     *     for (const auto& e : ex.getExceptions()) {
     *         try {
     *             if (e) std::rethrow_exception(e);
     *         } catch (const std::exception& innerEx) {
     *             std::cerr << "Task exception: " << innerEx.what() << std::endl;
     *         }
     *     }
